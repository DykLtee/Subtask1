Morse Code

//Overview(defination)

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-). It is used for transmitting messages through audible or visual signals and is especially useful in situations where voice communication is not possible.

Historical Context(backround)

Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail to be used with the electric telegraph system. It became a revolutionary way of communicating over long distances before the invention of the telephone and radio. For many years, Morse code was essential in maritime communication, particularly for sending distress signals such as the well-known SOS (··· --- ···).

//How It Work

Morse code represents each letter of the alphabet, numerals, and some punctuation marks using unique sequences of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes). These sequences can be transmitted via sound, light, or visual signs. For example:

A dot (·) is a short signal.

A dash (–) is a longer signal.


The system also includes specific timing rules:

A short gap between dots and dashes within a letter.

A longer gap between letters within a word.

The longest gap between words.


//Examples

Here are some words translated into Morse code:
